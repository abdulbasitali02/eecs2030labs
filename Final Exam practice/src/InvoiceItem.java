 *
 * The class should implement an item describing a line on an invoice: 
 * a product (including its name and price), and the quantity, as an integer 
 * The quantity above can be any integer (e.g., negative values indicate a product 
 * return for a refund)
 * 
 * The class is intended to be used in the implementation of another class or classes
 * 
 * ONE public constructor should exist:
 * InvoiceItem(Product product, int quantity): creates an invoice line item with 
 * the specified product and quantity
 * (you may add other - non-public - constructors, if you desire)
 * 
 * IMPORTANT
 * The product price may change after it's added to the invoice; however the price on the invoice
 * should not be affected (e.g., if product that sells for $2.00 is added to the invoice,
 * and then its price goes up to $2.50, the price of the items already added should remain $2.00.
 * However, if more items are added they will use the new price of $2.50
 * 
 * In addition, the following public methods should be implemented:
 * public Product getProduct()
 * public int getQuantity()
 * public void setQuantity(int quantity)
 * 
 * String toString()
 * this one should return a String in the form of "name, price=X, quantity=Y" 
 * where X is the item price, with two decimal digits; and Y is the quantity
 * 
 * IMPORTANT
 * You are expected to use the best practices you learned in EECS 2030 so far.
 * you may import any standard library classes, as necessary
 * e.g., import java.util.List;
 *
